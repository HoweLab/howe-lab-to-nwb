  experiment_description: |
    Dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) are key neuromodulators that regulate striatal circuits underlying movement 
    and reinforcement learning. Evidence suggests that DA and ACh systems interact, but where and how interactions are 
    expressed across striatal regions in behaviorally relevant release dynamics remains unknown. We applied micro-fiber 
    arrays to simultaneously measure striatum-wide DA and ACh in behaving mice, revealing an anatomical organization in 
    which DA-ACh anti-correlations were concentrated in a hotspot in the anterior dorsolateral striatum (aDLS). 
    Anti-correlations resulted from temporally coincident pairs of spontaneous and event-locked transient peak and dip 
    events occurring in a DA→ACh sequence. The aDLS localized hotspot was consistently expressed within distinct signals 
    associated with unpredicted rewards, learned and extinguished Pavlovian cues, and locomotion initiation and 
    invigoration phases, for which we revealed novel, opposing DA-ACh dynamics. Optogenetic activation of DA neurons 
    selectively suppressed spontaneous ACh release within the aDLS hotspot, and ex vivo recordings revealed enhanced 
    D2-mediated ACh inhibition in aDLS relative to ventral regions, suggesting a mechanistic basis for this spatial 
    specificity. These findings demonstrate that DA-ACh interactions during behavior are spatially organized, rather 
    than uniformly conserved, and shape behaviorally relevant dynamics to regulate region-specific functions in learning 
    and movement control.

    This dataset contains fiber photometry recordings from multi-fiber arrays implanted in the striatum in mice running 
    on a treadmill wheel or treadmill ball. Some sessions may include water reward delivery, where a water spout mounted 
    on a post delivered water rewards (9 μL) at random time intervals (randomly drawn from a 5-30s uniform distribution) 
    through a water spout and solenoid valve gated electronically. Some session include optogenetic midbrain stimulation 
    during unpredicted reward recordings. Some sessions include a Pavlovian task with 2 cues: visual (blue LED) or auditory 
    (12 kHz tone) stimuli at random intervals (4–40 s) and rewarded at 100% during the learning phase, or 80/20% during the 
    extinction phase (rewarded and extinguished cue, respectively). Licking was monitored by a capacitive touch circuit 
    connected to the spout.

  pharmacology: |
   Mice were anesthetized with 3-4% isoflurane and positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf instruments) on an electric 
   heating pad (Physitemp instruments). Pre-operative analgesia was administered using extended-release buprenorphine 
   (3.25 mg/kg, subcutaneous, Ethiqa XR). After induction, isoflurane was maintained at 1-2% (in 0.8-1 L min-1 pure oxygen), 
   with body temperature maintained at 37°C throughout surgery. The scalp was shaved and cleaned with iodine solution before 
   performing a large craniotomy over the right hemisphere with a surgical drill (Midwest Tradition 790044, Avtec Dental RMWT), 
   exposing the brain surface from 2.2 to -1.8 mm in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction and 0.49 to 3.4 mm in the medial-
   lateral (ML) direction relative to bregma. For simultaneous dopamine-acetylcholine extracellular recordings, 350 nl of a 
   1:6 mix of pAAV-hSyn-rDA3m (5.83 x 1012 VG ml-1, Bio hippo59) and AAV9-hSyn-ACh3.0 (5.86 x 1012 GC ml−1, Bio hippo 60) was 
   pressure-injected into the striatum of WT mice at a rate of 100nl/ min through a pulled glass pipette (tip diameter 30-50 μm) 
   at approximately 30 locations chosen to maximize expression around fiber tips. For control experiments, 500 nl of a 1:67 mix 
   of pAAV-CAG-tdTomato (Adgene #59462) and AAV9-hysn-ACh4.3-mut (WZ Biosciences) 60, was injected into the striatum of WT mice 
   using the same strategy.
